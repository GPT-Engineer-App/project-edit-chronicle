# project-edit-chronicle

Please create a new React application with the following:

- A basic App component that allows uploading a JSON file 
- When a file is selected, read the contents and parse the JSON
- Store the parsed JSON data in the App component's state
- Display a simple message confirming the file was uploaded and parsed
- Use Chakra UI components where appropriate 

Don't worry about the filtering or display of edits yet, just set up the core structure and file upload functionality to start.
